# ASTANK2_system
Homework about the study of the ASTANK2 system at the Modeling and Simulation course at UPB. In "ASTANK2.pdf" is explained how the system works, its parameters, defined constants, and the nonlinear set of equation that models it. "ASTANK2_tasks.m" contains the full analysis of the system, its liniarization and errors following the procedure.
